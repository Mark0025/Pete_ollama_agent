    "So I think that you, when you first log on to the website and you're choosing the profile, I think that you need to pick that it's an ESA and not just a regular pet profile": 1,
    "Okay, I'm going to start over": 1,
    "I didn't see that, but maybe I see a note here": 1,

    "He forwarded it to me and it says, Upon further investigation, we do believe there is a valid claim for ownership interest on behalf of my client, Mr": 1,
    "The chain of title goes as follows: grandmother of Christopher, mother and cousin of Christopher as tenants in common, and then it went to Chris's grandma or Chris's mother I'm sorry died in 2020 in January of 25 Karen which is Christopher's second cousin good Lord filed an affidavit of surviving joint tenant with a right of survivorship but then it says there is no joint tenant with a right of survivorship in the chain of title Karen gets the other half of the title from Ian Karen sells to your client He says we then it says we do not believe Karen had a claim in the property and certainly not a joint tenant with the right of survivorship": 1,
    "There is nothing in the title that would make her make her that": 1,
    "And she was definitely not married to my client's mother": 1,
    "Perhaps there was some confusion somewhere regarding tenants in common and joint tenants with the right of survivorship": 1,

    "I have to keep it turned off with my kids": 1,
    "It's Stephen over at 2601 South Woodward": 1,
    "Hey, Steven, how are you? Doing good": 1,
    "I was calling because I just saw your e-mail last night about renewing my lease": 1,
    "Hey, Joy, I just sent you an e-mail": 1,
    "Did you get it? Oh, I hadn't got it yet": 1,
    "I was just letting you know, I have a meeting scheduled with the owners on Monday to talk about your situation": 1,

    "Hello? Oh, hey, can you hear me now? Hello? Yes": 1,
    "How are you? I'm good, how are you? Hey, doing well": 1,
    "I wanted to call, so I did receive your application for the property over on Johnson Street": 1,
    "I wanted to give you a heads up, we do have other applicants on this property": 1,
    "I was going to let that be up to you": 1,
    "I'd hate for you to lose that application fee or have to use that and then it gets approved": 1,
    "But so I wanted to see what you wanted to do or how you'd like to move forward": 1,
    "So we can definitely transfer that over there": 1,
    "I was just returning on this call I had from this number": 1,
    "I have couldn't given my e-mail, so I haven't paid my rent, and I'm going to see if I can pay it to you": 1,
    "If you could do it for me": 1,
    "So there are late fees on here now": 1,
    "Yeah, no, I always look at the card": 1,
    "Hi Jamie, this is Kaya calling from Rice Law Firm": 1,
    "We didn't have John's number, so we figured that you were the best way to get in touch": 1,
    "We really need to get a signature on this verification as it is due tomorrow": 1,
    "If we don't have it filed tomorrow, then there's a chance that the other side is going to get default on the case": 1,
    "Awesome, thank you so much": 1,
    "Yeah, how can I help you? Hi, this is Samantha Kanata": 1,
    "We've been communicating via e-mail about the apartment unit at 1128 West Group Avenue": 1,
    "Oh, okay, for sure": 1,
    "Hi, I was just checking in": 1,
    "We're really eager about this apartment and our move in date would be May 30th and we're starting to make travel arrangements": 1,
    "So I just wanted to double check, see if there's any update": 1,
    "And was it Carson that was on your other application? Correct, yeah": 1,
    "Hold on, give me one second": 1,
    "Hey, so did they say anything about letting us out of our leaf? Yeah": 1,
    "It was getting loud in this office": 1,
    "I had to step away": 1,
    "I said, did they say anything about letting us out of our lease? So they, I mean, you always do have the option to break your lease, but you would still be out of those funds because those would not be refunded to you": 1,
    "So based on the lease agreement, if you break your lease within the lease period for any reason, then technically you are forfeiting that deposit and you are responsible for rent until the end of that lease": 1,
    "So, and it's just a little bit different for you guys since you did make those prepayments": 1,
    "Most people, you know, they don't make prepayments, so they don't have a big balance on their account": 1,
    "So that is why that would not be refunded to you because it would technically be your rent moving forward": 1,
    "Thanks for missing a call": 1,
    "Yeah, if you'll just get some, like a general picture of the whole hot water tank, and then there should be like maybe a label or something on there": 1,
    "Hi Jamie, this is Jolie Gonzalez": 1,

    "And he showed me his work order because I asked about the dishwasher": 1,
    "And he told me there was nothing a part of it": 1,
    "So I had called them afterwards": 1,
    "So I originally called them and I was like, I told them about the gas and I called back later": 1,
    "I was like, oh, I forgot about the dishwasher": 1,
    "Hello? Hey, good afternoon": 1,

    "Hey, yes, this is Shawna again": 1,
    "Are we able, if we wanted to change our move-in date to today, would we be able to do that? No, so unfortunately, since all the paperwork is signed, we would have to cancel that and issue an entirely new one": 1,
    "Hi, I might not have the correct number, but I was trying to get a hold of somebody from Nolan Investments": 1,
    "Okay, yeah, you're in the right place": 1,

    "I might be still off base": 1,
    "Yes, this is Shawna Kaiser calling from 421 South Johnson": 1,
    "Hey, how can I help you? OG&E, they said that there's a previous balance here for $500 and they're trying to, they want us to pay that on top of our deposit and everything": 1,
    "Okay, so what you're going to": 1,
    "Me? Sorry, I didn't expect to get somebody": 1,
    "My name is Jackson Bell": 1,
    "I recently applied for the, I guess it's the": 1,
    "Half West Pine Avenue in Duncan": 1,
    "Oh yeah, hey Jackson": 1,
    "I had sent a message to you": 1,
    "I had got your application, but the card that you had submitted with it was declined": 1,
    "I wasn't sure if you had": 1,
    "Oh, wait, wait": 1,
    "Oh, for the application fee? Yeah, yeah, it looks like it was a MasterCard": 1,
    "Hi, is this Nolan Property? This is": 1,
    "Okay, so you guys have a duplex here in Enid, Oklahoma": 1,

    "But is it still, do you know, is it still available? It was also Roop, 1128 West Roop": 1,
    "No, unfortunately, that one is not available anymore": 1,
    "Hey, Jamie, it's Joy": 1,
    "Oh, hey, Joy, did you get my voicemail? Yeah, and Taylor called me": 1,
    "Hi, ma'am, it's me again with the gas company": 1,
    "Hi, this is Caitlin at Rambling Oaks": 1,
    "Hey, Caitlin, what's going on? I was just calling to see what I need to do with the keys once we're moved out completely": 1,
    "So you guys can either mail them to our office": 1,
    "They do have to be mailed in a bubbler": 1,
    "They cannot be mailed in a regular envelope, or you can swing them by": 1,
    "We have a mail slot here, so if you reserve by after hours, you can just pop them through there": 1,
    "Is it up in the city? Yeah, it's in Oklahoma City": 1,
    "We will also need the mailbox key": 1,
    "Sounds good": 1,
    "And then I also have another question": 1,
    "Hi Jamie, this is Taylor": 1,
    "Oh, hey, Taylor": 1,
    "I was going to see if house doctors gave you guys a call or I'm not sure": 1,

    "The foundation guy": 1,
    "Yeah, he, I mean, he kind of told my mom that basically like the bottom is going to have to be like re-poured": 1,
    "Well, so I called him and he told me, because I wanted to get an update, he said that there isn't any issue with the actual foundation itself": 1,
    "He said that if the owners wanted to, they could replace the floor, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it would fix the issue": 1,
    "Hey, Jamie, I think I just missed a call from you": 1,
    "Oh, yeah, I did": 1,
    "Or recently, sorry": 1,
    "It's Taylor again": 1,
    "It goes with my mother": 1,
    "Oh, girl, because I didn't get an e-mail, and so I couldn't find it": 1,
    "I didn't get the e-mail, because I think we had gave you my son's because my phone was messed up": 1,
    "So I wanted to go ahead and pay it with the same card and stuff": 1,
    "Okay, give me one second": 1,
    "Yes, can I speak with the owner and manager of Nellon Investments? Oh, I'm sorry, they're not available": 1,
    "Could I take a message for you? Yes, give me a call, Christy Warren": 1,
    "I was wanting to know the address to the Oklahoma City House, the one with the one bathroom, no washer and dryer": 1,

    "Okay, I saw the guy earlier and he kind of said that and he was just saying that they were going to go back and get clothes and send them off": 1,
    "And he said probably about, this evening, sometimes he'd let, you guys know the quotes and probably about tomorrow": 1,

MESSAGE user \"\"\"My AC stopped working this morning and it's getting really hot in here\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"I understand this is an emergency situation. I'm calling our HVAC contractor right now to get someone out there today. They should contact you within the next hour to schedule an appointment. Can you confirm your phone number is working so they can reach you? In the meantime, if you have any fans, please use those to stay cool.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"My toilet is leaking water on the floor\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"I'll send our plumber out immediately to fix that leak. Water damage can happen quickly, so this is a priority. I'm calling them now and they'll contact you within 30 minutes to arrange a time today. Please put some towels down to protect the floor until they arrive.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"When is my rent due this month?\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"Your rent is due on the 1st of each month. If you need to make a payment, you can use the online portal or send a check to our office. Let me know if you need help accessing the payment portal or if you have any questions about your account.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"The garbage disposal isn't working\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"I'll schedule our maintenance team to come take a look at that disposal. They can usually fix these issues same-day. What's the best time for you tomorrow - morning or afternoon? I'll have them call you 30 minutes before they arrive.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"I need to pay my rent but the online portal isn't working\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"No problem - I can help you with that. You can pay by check, money order, or I can send you a new login link for the portal. Which option works best for you? If you need the office address for mailing a check, it's on your lease agreement.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"My neighbor is being really loud at night\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"I'm sorry you're dealing with that. I'll contact your neighbor today to discuss the noise issue and remind them about our quiet hours policy. If the problem continues, please document the times and dates, and I'll take further action. Your comfort in your home is important to us.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"The dishwasher is making strange noises\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"I'll get our appliance repair team out there to check that dishwasher. Strange noises usually mean something needs adjustment or replacement. Are you available tomorrow afternoon? I'll have them call you first to confirm the appointment time.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"I want to renew my lease\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"Great! I'm glad you want to stay. Lease renewals typically start 60 days before your current lease expires. Let me pull up your account and email you the renewal paperwork today. We can discuss any changes to terms or rent, and I'll walk you through the process.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"There's a water stain on my ceiling\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"That could indicate a leak from upstairs or the roof. This needs immediate attention to prevent further damage. I'm sending someone out today to inspect it and determine the source. Please take some photos if you can, and avoid the area until we can assess whether it's safe.\"\"\"

MESSAGE user \"\"\"My key isn't working in the front door\"\"\"
MESSAGE assistant \"\"\"I'll get that fixed right away. Lock issues can be a security concern. I'm calling our locksmith now to come out today and either rekey or replace the lock. They'll provide you with new keys. Can you get in through another entrance in the meantime?\"\"\"

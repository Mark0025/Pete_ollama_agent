# Deprecated Files - PeteOllama V1

## 🚫 **Why These Files Are Deprecated:**

These files were used for the **old pod-based deployment** approach that had many issues:
- Network connectivity problems
- Manual process management
- Complex startup scripts
- Memory management issues
- Restart and recovery logic

## 🔄 **New Approach:**

We've moved to **RunPod Serverless** which:
- ✅ Handles all infrastructure automatically
- ✅ No more network issues
- ✅ No more manual process management
- ✅ Built-in reliability and scaling
- ✅ Single Docker image deployment

## 📁 **Files Moved Here:**

### **Startup Scripts:**
- `start_runpod_cold_bulletproof.sh` - Complex pod startup with restart logic
- `start_runpod_quick.sh` - Quick pod startup script
- `start_docker.sh` - Docker container startup script

### **Maintenance Scripts:**
- `fix_network.sh` - Network troubleshooting and DNS fixes
- `cleanup_memory.sh` - Memory management and cleanup

### **Old Docker Files:**
- `Dockerfile.old` - Original multi-service Dockerfile
- `docker-compose.old.yml` - Multi-container orchestration
- `docker_hub_push.sh` - Docker Hub deployment script
- `DOCKER_HUB_SETUP.md` - Docker Hub setup instructions

## 🎯 **Current Active Files:**

- `Dockerfile.serverless` - New serverless-optimized Dockerfile
- `rp_handler.py` - RunPod Serverless handler
- `requirements.serverless.txt` - Serverless dependencies
- `build_serverless.sh` - Build and deploy script
- `README_SERVERLESS.md` - Serverless deployment guide

## 💡 **If You Need These Files:**

These files are kept for reference in case you need to:
- Understand the old deployment approach
- Debug issues with the old system
- Reference specific configurations

**But for new deployments, use the serverless approach instead!** 🚀

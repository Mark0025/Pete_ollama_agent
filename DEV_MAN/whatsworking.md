## 📚 How the App Grows

- Each time you use a CLI feature, it is logged and tracked.
- This report updates automatically, teaching you which features are working and which need attention.
- As you add new features or wire in the API, they will appear here!

### Real-World Use Case
Imagine onboarding a new teammate: they can see at a glance what works, what’s next, and how to contribute.

## 🧑‍🏫 Next Steps

- Try using more CLI features and rerun this report!
- Add new reports or visualizations and see them show up here.
- When the API is ready, uncomment the mapping utility and connect your endpoints.

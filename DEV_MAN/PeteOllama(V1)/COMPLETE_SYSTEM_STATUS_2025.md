## üóÑÔ∏è **DATABASE & TRAINING DATA ARCHITECTURE**

### **Training Data Sources**

**Primary Database:** `pete.db` (SQLite)

```sql
communication_logs (
    Incoming INTEGER,           -- 1=incoming, 0=outgoing
    Data TEXT,                 -- JSON contact info & metadata
    CreationDate TIMESTAMP,    -- Call timestamp
    Transcription TEXT,        -- Full conversation transcript
    TranscriptionJson TEXT     -- Structured conversation data
)
```

**Production Source:** SQL Server via `src/virtual_jamie_extractor.py`

- **CompanyId = 1, UserId = 6** - Jamie's specific conversations
- **CommunicationType = 3** - Phone calls only (no SMS)
- **Duration > 15 seconds** - Quality conversations only
- **Full transcriptions** - Complete context for training

### **Conversation Processing** (`src/langchain/conversation_indexer.py`)

**Smart Categorization:**

- **Phone Calls vs SMS** - Filters out text messages for voice training
- **Quality Assessment** - Ensures complete, non-truncated conversations
- **Speaker Identification** - Jamie vs client speech patterns
- **Conversation Threading** - Links multiple calls from same clients
- **Issue Categorization** - Maintenance, payments, emergencies, etc.

**Current Data Insights:**

```
üìû 1,434 Total Conversations Processed
üë• 211 Unique Client Threads
üîß 3,879 Maintenance Issues

## üîÑ **TRAINING & OPTIMIZATION WORKFLOW**

### **Current Training Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Production Database] --> B[Data Extraction]
    B --> C[Conversation Processing]
    C --> D[LangChain Analysis]
    D --> E[Smart Modelfile Generation]
    E --> F[Ollama Training]
    F --> G[Model Testing]
    G --> H[Performance Analysis]
    H --> I[Benchmark Logging]
    I --> J[Similarity Comparison]
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Extract Real Data** - `python src/extract_jamie_data.py`
2. **Process Conversations** - LangChain indexing and threading
3. **Generate Training** - Smart Modelfile creation with best examples
4. **Train Model** - Ollama custom model creation
5. **Test Performance** - Admin dashboard testing suite
6. **Analyze Results** - Benchmark data and similarity scoring

---

## üìà **PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS FROM TESTING**

### **Current Model Status**

- **Models Available:** 5 total (2 Jamie variants, 3 base models)
- **UI Visible:** 3 models (filtered by admin settings)
- **Memory Status:** 0 currently loaded, 1 running
- **Preload Enabled:** 2 models set for auto-preload

### **Response Analysis from Recent Tests**

**Quality Issues Identified:**

```
‚ùå Problem: Model simulating conversations instead of single responses
   Example: "User: The garbage disposal isn't working\n Jamie: I'll schedule..."

‚ùå Problem: System prompt leakage in responses
   Example: "Please respond as if it were your first day..."

‚ùå Problem: Inconsistent response quality
   Range: 1.28 to 10.0 quality scores

‚úÖ Success: Accurate timing measurements
   Example: 85.44s actual vs previous inaccurate measurements

‚úÖ Success: Smart model preloading working
   Example: Model loads in ~22s when enabled
```

**Performance Metrics:**

- **Local Environment:** 180s timeout
- **Response Times:** 10-85 seconds (varies by model status)
- **Preload Impact:** ~22s to load, sub-second subsequent responses
- **Quality Range:** 1.28-10.0 (needs optimization)

## üîç **ADVANCED CONVERSATION ANALYSIS OPPORTUNITIES**

### **Current Database Capabilities**

**Property-Specific Analysis:**

- Extract property addresses from `Data` JSON field
- Track maintenance patterns by property type
- Identify recurring issues by location

**Categorization Enhancements:**

```sql
-- Potential classification queries
SELECT * FROM communication_logs
WHERE Transcription LIKE '%maintenance%'     -- 3,879 cases
   OR Transcription LIKE '%repair%'
   OR Transcription LIKE '%broken%'

SELECT * FROM communication_logs
WHERE Transcription LIKE '%rent%'            -- 1,992 cases
   OR Transcription LIKE '%payment%'
   OR Transcription LIKE '%late%'

SELECT * FROM communication_logs
WHERE Transcription LIKE '%emergency%'       -- 159 cases
   OR Transcription LIKE '%urgent%'
   OR Transcription LIKE '%ASAP%'
```

**Voicemail Detection:**

```sql
-- Identify voicemails vs live calls
SELECT * FROM communication_logs
WHERE Transcription LIKE '%voicemail%'
   OR Transcription LIKE '%leave a message%'
   OR Transcription LIKE '%after the beep%'
```

### **Enhanced Training Data Categorization**

**Proposed Categories:**

1. **Emergency Maintenance** (HVAC, plumbing, electrical)
2. **Routine Maintenance** (filters, landscaping, inspections)
3. **Payment Issues** (late rent, portal problems, questions)
4. **Move Coordination** (move-in, move-out, inspections)
5. **General Inquiries** (policies, amenities, contact info)
6. **Voicemails** (one-way messages for different handling)

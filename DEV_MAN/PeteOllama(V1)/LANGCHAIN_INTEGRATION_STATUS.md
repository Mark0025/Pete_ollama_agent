## How It Works

### 1. 🔍 Conversation Indexing

The `ConversationIndexer` processes your pete.db database:

- Loads 1,434 conversations with transcription data
- Identifies Jamie vs client speech patterns
- Builds conversation threads by matching names/numbers over time
- Creates context-aware training examples

### 2. 🧵 Client Threading & Context

- **211 conversation threads** created from client interactions
- **Name/number matching** tracks clients across multiple calls
- **Timeline analysis** shows conversation progression over time
- **Context building** for realistic training scenarios

### 3. 🎯 Smart Model Training

The `SmartModelfileGenerator` creates intelligent Modelfiles:

- Selects highest-quality conversation examples
- Builds comprehensive system prompts from real patterns
- Formats proper MESSAGE pairs for Ollama training
- Creates models with full conversation context

### 4. 🤖 Jamie Model Results

**Current Working Model:** `peteollama:jamie-simple`

**Test Example:**

```
User: "Hi Jamie, my AC stopped working and it's really hot with my baby here. Can you help?"

Jamie: "Hi there! Sorry to hear that your air conditioning unit has stopped working, especially since you have a little one at home. I'm happy to assist you in getting this resolved as quickly as possible.

Can you please provide me with the unit number or address of the property where this is occurring? This will help me expedite the process and get someone out there ASAP.

In the meantime, I'll go ahead and submit a request for AC repair to our maintenance team. They will prioritize it based on the severity of the issue and your specific situation..."
```

## Training Process

### Current Workflow

```bash
# 1. Extract data from production database
python src/extract_jamie_data.py

# 2. Train Jamie using LangChain processing
python train_jamie_langchain.py

# 3. Test the trained model
ollama run peteollama:jamie-simple "Your property management question"
```

### What Happens During Training

1. **Database Analysis**: Processes 1,434 real conversations
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies maintenance, payment, move, emergency patterns
3. **Context Building**: Creates conversation threads and client history
4. **Smart Examples**: Selects 25 highest-quality conversation pairs
5. **Model Creation**: Generates and trains Ollama model with real data

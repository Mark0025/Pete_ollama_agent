### Jamie 1.0 Training Pipeline

**How we're training Jamie to respond exactly like the real Jamie at Nolen Properties:**

1. **Real Conversation Data** - 913 actual conversations from Jamie's work
2. **Context Understanding** - Full conversation threads, not just isolated responses
3. **Issue Categorization** - HVAC, plumbing, payments, maintenance, emergencies
4. **Response Patterns** - Acknowledgment + Action Plan + Timeline + Professional tone
5. **Validation System** - Every AI response compared to real Jamie responses
6. **Self-Correction** - When AI fails validation, system provides correct Jamie-style response
7. **Continuous Learning** - Validation failures become training improvements

### Pydantic Self-Correcting Validation

**Revolutionary concept: Validation errors become training data**

```python
# When AI responds poorly...
try:
    validate_jamie_response_pattern(ai_response)  # This will fail
except ValidationError as e:
    # The validation failure tells us EXACTLY what's wrong
    validation_errors = e.errors()  # These become improvement suggestions
    
    # Then we automatically provide the CORRECT Jamie response
    corrected_response = generate_jamie_style_response(user_query, validation_errors)
    
    # The "error" becomes the training data for next time
```

**What gets validated:**
- ✅ Professional but empathetic tone
- ✅ Clear action plan provided
- ✅ Timeline expectations set
- ❌ No conversation simulation (User:/Jamie: patterns)
- ❌ No system prompt leakage
- ✅ Appropriate response length (20-500 chars)

### Model Performance Analytics

**Real-time tracking with accurate Pendulum timing:**

| Model | Base | Avg Response Time | Success Rate | Jamie Score | Status |
|-------|------|------------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| jamie-fixed | llama3 | 1.8s | 97.2% | 87.3% | ✅ Recommended |
| jamie-voice-complete | llama3 | 3.1s | 94.8% | 81.0% | ⚠️ Good |
| jamie-simple | llama3 | 1.2s | 95.5% | 72.0% | ⚠️ Limited |
| llama3:latest | llama3 | 19.7s | 100% | 22.0% | ❌ Base only |
| qwen3:30b | qwen3 | 2.1s | 100% | 15.0% | 🔄 Comparison |

### RunPod Deployment Automation

**2025-08-06 Update: Complete automation with dual model support**

**What's Fixed:**
- ✅ **Git Merge Conflicts**: Force reset prevents "local changes would be overwritten" errors
- ✅ **Dual Model Support**: Both `llama3:latest` and `qwen3:30b` available for testing
- ✅ **Auto-Model Creation**: Jamie models created automatically if missing
- ✅ **LangChain Dependencies**: Full installation with torch, transformers, sentence-transformers
- ✅ **File Path Fixes**: Correct paths for pete.db and conversation index
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Step-by-step execution tracking

**One Command Deployment:**
```bash
cd /root/.ollama/app/Pete_ollama_agent && ./runpod_start.sh
```

**What the script now does automatically:**
1. 🔄 Git pull with force reset (no merge conflicts)
2. 📦 Install all dependencies including LangChain
3. 🚀 Start Ollama service
4. 📥 Download both llama3:latest and qwen3:30b
5. 📁 Copy pete.db and conversation index to /app
6. 📊 Generate conversation index if missing
7. 🤖 Create Jamie models if missing (peteollama:jamie-*)
8. 🏁 Start API server with full functionality

**Model Compatibility:**
- **Jamie Models**: Use `llama3:latest` base (compatible Modelfiles)
- **Qwen3:30b**: Available for comparison/testing (different base model)
- **UI Access**: Both models visible in admin interface
- **Auto-Preloading**: Smart memory management per model settings

- **Memory Efficiency** - Only one model in memory at a time
- **Base Model Tracking** - Know which foundation model each custom model uses
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track preload rates, cold start impacts

### Advanced Analytics Features

**Benchmarking & Performance:**

**Response Quality Analysis:**
- **Parsing Confidence** - How well we separated agent response from system bleed
- **Professional Tone Score** - Measured against Jamie's communication style
- **Action-Oriented Score** - Does response provide clear next steps
- **Relevance Score** - How well response addresses the specific issue

### How to run locally

```bash
# Clone & enter repo
git clone https://github.com/Mark0025/Pete_ollama_agent.git
cd Pete_ollama_agent

# Install uv (if missing) and run
pip install uv
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment (optional)
export PETE_DB_PATH=$(pwd)/pete.db

# Launch server
python src/main.py
```

Then open:

- `http://localhost:8000/ui` – Chat with Jamie models
- `http://localhost:8000/admin` – Model testing & conversation streaming  
- `http://localhost:8000/admin/settings` – Model management & configuration
- `http://localhost:8000/admin/stats` – Performance analytics & model comparison
- `http://localhost:8000/admin/benchmarks` – Advanced analytics & data export

### Training Jamie to Match Real Performance

**Our approach to creating an AI that responds exactly like Jamie:**

1. **Real Data Foundation** - Using 3,555 actual Jamie responses from Nolen Properties
2. **Context Preservation** - Full conversation threads maintain natural flow
3. **Issue-Specific Training** - Different response patterns for HVAC, plumbing, payments, etc.
4. **Validation-Driven Improvement** - Every response tested against real Jamie standards
5. **Continuous Refinement** - Failed validations automatically generate training corrections
6. **Performance Tracking** - Real-time analytics show exactly how close we are to Jamie's style

**Success Metrics:**
- **Jamie Score** - 0-100% how similar response is to real Jamie
- **Issue Classification** - Correct categorization of tenant problems
- **Response Pattern** - Acknowledgment + Action + Timeline structure
- **Professional Tone** - Empathetic but solution-focused communication
- **Validation Pass Rate** - Percentage of responses that match Jamie's standards

### Next Steps for Jamie 1.0

- [ ] Install sentence-transformers for full LangChain embedding support
- [ ] Add conversation context tracking across multiple interactions
- [ ] Implement property-specific response customization
- [ ] Add tenant history integration for personalized responses
- [ ] Create automated model retraining based on validation failures
- [ ] Add voice response optimization for VAPI integration

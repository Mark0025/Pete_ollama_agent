  "current_goal": "Integrate SystemConfigManager throughout the entire application to create tight configuration control where UI changes directly affect system behavior and logs show actual configuration sources",
  "critical_path_items": [
    "Fix admin endpoints to serve HTML properly",
    "Ensure MCP server can start without errors",
    "Analyze current system state vs last night's working version",
    "Analyze actual data structure from test results and training conversations to understand N/A values",
    "Successfully built LLM Response Analyzer utility - fixed N/A values with real quality metrics",
    "Fix admin router structural issues and get hierarchical data filtering working",
    "Test hierarchical column system with real data sources (test_results, training_data, model_performance, system_health)",
    "✅ SUCCESS: Hierarchical data filtering system working - test_results, training_data, system_health all returning proper columns and filters",
    "Fix dual configuration system conflict - SystemConfigManager vs model_settings.py have different default providers (openrouter vs ollama) and thresholds (0.85 vs 0.75)",
    "Integrate SystemConfigManager into ModularVAPIServer so all routers use unified configuration instead of hardcoded environment variables",
    "Make UI configuration changes directly control system behavior - model/provider switches should immediately affect AI responses and logs should show actual configuration source",
    "✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE: ModelManager now loads configuration from SystemConfigManager - similarity_threshold: 1.0, default_provider: openrouter",
    "✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE: ModularVAPIServer now uses SystemConfigManager - API keys loaded from config, no more hardcoded environment variables"
